## 📦 Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
gemini-rust = "1.5.0"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Content Generation

Get started with simple text generation, system prompts, and conversations. See [`basic_generation.rs`](examples/basic_generation.rs) for complete examples including simple messages, system prompts, and multi-turn conversations.

### Streaming Responses

Enable real-time content streaming for interactive applications. See [`basic_streaming.rs`](examples/basic_streaming.rs) for examples of processing content as it's generated with immediate display.

## 🛠️ Key Features

The library provides comprehensive access to all Gemini 2.5 capabilities through an intuitive Rust API:

### 🧠 **Thinking Mode (Gemini 2.5)**

Advanced reasoning capabilities with thought process visibility and custom thinking budgets. See [`thinking_basic.rs`](examples/thinking_basic.rs) and [`thinking_advanced.rs`](examples/thinking_advanced.rs).

### 🛠️ **Function Calling & Tools**

- Custom function declarations with OpenAPI schema support (using `schemars`)
- Google Search integration for real-time information
- Type-safe function definitions with automatic schema generation
- See [`tools.rs`](examples/tools.rs) and [`complex_function.rs`](examples/complex_function.rs)

### 🎨 **Multimodal Generation**

- **Image Generation**: Text-to-image with detailed prompts and editing capabilities
- **Speech Generation**: Text-to-speech with single and multi-speaker support
- **Image Processing**: Analyze images, videos, and binary data
- See [`image_generation.rs`](examples/image_generation.rs) and [`multi_speaker_tts.rs`](examples/multi_speaker_tts.rs)

### 📦 **Batch Processing**

Efficient processing of multiple requests with automatic file handling for large jobs. See [`batch_generate.rs`](examples/batch_generate.rs).

### 💾 **Content Caching**

Cache system instructions and conversation history to reduce costs and improve performance. See [`cache_basic.rs`](examples/cache_basic.rs).

### 📊 **Text Embeddings**

Advanced embedding generation with multiple task types for document retrieval and semantic search. See [`embedding.rs`](examples/embedding.rs).

### 🔄 **Streaming Responses**

Real-time streaming of generated content for interactive applications. See [`streaming.rs`](examples/streaming.rs).

### ⚙️ **Highly Configurable**

- Custom models and endpoints
- Detailed generation parameters (temperature, tokens, etc.)
- HTTP client customization with timeouts and proxies
- See [`generation_config.rs`](examples/generation_config.rs) and [`custom_base_url.rs`](examples/custom_base_url.rs)

### 🔍 **Observability**

Built-in structured logging and telemetry with `tracing` for comprehensive monitoring and debugging.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Custom Models

Configure different Gemini models including Flash, Pro, Lite, and custom models. See [`custom_models.rs`](examples/custom_models.rs) for examples of all model configuration options including convenience methods, enum variants, and custom model strings.

### Custom Base URL

Use custom API endpoints and configurations. See [`custom_base_url.rs`](examples/custom_base_url.rs) for examples of configuring custom endpoints with different models.

### Configurable HTTP Client Builder

For advanced HTTP configuration (timeouts, proxies, custom headers), use the builder pattern. See [`http_client_builder.rs`](examples/http_client_builder.rs) for a complete example with custom timeouts, user agents, connection pooling, and proxy configuration.

## 🔍 Tracing and Telemetry

The library is instrumented with the `tracing` crate to provide detailed telemetry data for monitoring and debugging. This allows you to gain deep insights into the library's performance and behavior.

Key tracing features include:

- **HTTP Request Tracing**: Captures detailed information about every API call, including HTTP method, URL, and response status, to help diagnose network-related issues
- **Token Usage Monitoring**: Records the number of prompt, candidate, and total tokens for each generation request, enabling cost analysis and optimization
- **Structured Logging**: Emits traces as structured events, compatible with modern log aggregation platforms like Elasticsearch, Datadog, and Honeycomb, allowing for powerful querying and visualization
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides timing information for each API request, allowing you to identify and address performance bottlenecks

To use these features, you will need to integrate a `tracing` subscriber into your application. See [`tracing_telemetry.rs`](examples/tracing_telemetry.rs) for comprehensive examples including basic console logging, structured logging for production, and environment-based log level filtering.

## 📚 Examples

The repository includes 30+ comprehensive examples demonstrating all features. See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) for detailed information.
