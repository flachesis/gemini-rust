//! Batch delete example
//!
//! This example demonstrates how to delete a batch operation after it has completed.
//! Deleting a batch operation removes its metadata from the system but does not cancel
//! a running operation.
//!
//! To run this example, you need to have a Gemini API key and an existing batch operation.
//! You can get an API key from the Google AI Studio.
//!
//! Once you have the API key, you can run this example by setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY`
//! and `BATCH_NAME` environment variables:
//!
//! ```sh
//! export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
//! export BATCH_NAME=your_batch_name
//! cargo run --package gemini-rust --example batch_delete
//! ```
